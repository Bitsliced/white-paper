## **WHITE PAPER**

English - Version 3.2 - 12. March 2022

**1. The Vision**

**Imagine** the following scenario. You log into this immersive new app that allows you to **collect, buy, sell, track, swap** and **lend** all kinds of amazing real world objects. You are an avid collector of watches and created your own **channel** in the app. **Channels** are like repositories for things that you own - physical and virtual items are showing up in the form of **NFT&#39;s**. The channel itself was minted, and owning one is a big deal. You are able to invite others that share your interest in vintage pocket watches. Every new member means that you - as the channel owner - make more revenue. These channels are like _miniature hedge funds_, but instead of storing shares of companies in them, you collect **slices - fractions -** or **whole** parts of things like **raribles, art, real estate, automotives, bikes, yachts, comic books, wine collections.**

Your portfolio of **collections** includes a **slice** of a 1926 Macallan Scotch Whiskey bottle stored and owned by a collector in Baltimore. You could never afford the whole bottle, but through **Bitsliced** you were able to buy a 1% stake. Your portfolio is composed of **slices** of painting from an unknown new artist, you own 1/100th of a Patek Phillipe watch from a owner in Sydney, a small stake in a pure breed race horse in Dubai and naturally all the minted **NFT&#39;s** of your own physical items: your motorbike, your car and your apartment.

All these investments are growing at different rates and as your valuables grow in value, other collectors, community members and investors join your channel to share information,

Maybe **swap some slices** against yours. Your portfolio is colourful, diverse, international and foremost it has become **profitable**. It is fun to add **fractions** of more stuff, to search for other interesting objects - all over the world! And yes, you like to show off to your family and friends. This has become like a **game!** The possibilities are endless and through the

Genius **minting process** you can trust that all your assets are **real, exist** and are not **counterfeits** and appraise regularly in value, which is easy to assess through the app statistics.

 Other members of the growing community are constantly updating prices, adding more items and exchanging information. This has become the &quot;stock market&quot; of objects. The company that created the app is coming out with a more advanced version of their platform. Next year, you will be able to move all these virtual items into a _metaverse_. Then you are able to

Interact with your collections at a whole new level! Virtual car dealerships show you cars that are physically in different geographic locations. You can experience them through virtual reality and decide to add another **slice** to one of your channels that represent collections.

**Practical execution**

This is the vision, but we have to start somewhere on our path to this scenario. **Bitsliced** is in its current state a good starting point. We wanted to share the full - albeit somewhat idealistic - vision with the community, so that you know where this journey leads. Not all elements are set in place today. We have started to create some of the features mentioned in our vision, but not all of them are feasible at this moment. Sometimes this is because of technical reasons and sometimes due to financial constraints, but we believe that **Bitsliced** is paving the way to eventually reach the vision described above.

**A true financial revolution!**

In 1602 something remarkable happened. The first company stock was born: the Dutch East India Company became available to the general public. This was a real financial breakthrough that would change the world forever. Up to that moment, all wealth was private. In the hands of wealthy families or individuals. This was the first time ever that someone could own a **fractional piece** of an economic venture.

Blockchain technology and other developments have opened the door to create _fractionalized ownership_ of _ **anything!** _ We can now own &quot;pieces&quot; of things that are represented through a digital representation on the blockchain. This is the foundation to unlock assets that weren&#39;t tradable until now. This technology will make anything publicly tradable - every car, every painting, every small business like a barber shop, a restaurant. People could take a direct stake in a business that exists across the globe.

This might sound fictitious and strange, but we are already there. Any stock is in reality an abstraction in the form of a digital certificate that proves ownership in a company. Another example are QR-codes used as substitutes for vaccine passports. The underlying complexity, the type of vaccine, the country where the vaccine was taken. All of these details are summarised in the form of a **universal identifier** that is represented by that QR-code.

There are already cases of **fractionalized ownership.** The 2020 Kentucky Derby winner is a three year old pure breed called &quot;Authentic&quot; and is owned by 4,200 owners that bought a micro-share of US$ 206.
# 1
 Only uber-wealthy individuals could afford a pure breed a couple of years ago. **Fractionalized ownership** opens investment opportunities to investors that until now were left out of certain asset classes.

Opening up privately held assets to a global public will create the greatest trading opportunity and wealth creation in over 400 years of financial history! Have a look at a few examples. Private collectors have sold over Â£40m worth of rare whisky at auctions in 2018 alone.
# 2
 The value of rare whisky has seen an increase of 582% in value since 2009 and is one of the most stable asset classes - surpassing rare collectible vintage cars.

The secondary market (collectors) for luxury watches sits at $20bn per year (2020)
# 3
. The global classic car market will reach $36bn in 2022 alone.
# 4
 We could go on with art, luxury fashion items, fountain pens, wine and the king of investment classes: real estate! In combination, privately held assets are estimated to be around $2.1 Quadrillion!
# 5

The foundation for this is not only of technological nature. This level of trade will require **trust** and **transparency.**

**CEO: Pedro Ferreira**

**CFO: Randy van Brienen**

**Operations Lead: Chris Maehl**

**Bitsliced** is composed of 3 core elements: **the NFT marketplace in a Progressive Web App (PWA), a crypto token based on the Polygon network and a business model tailored to specific industries like real estate and automotive sales distributors.**

**3. The DNA of the SLICED token**

**3.1 Why was a proprietary token necessary?**

Whilst it is true that there are many crypto tokens and coins out there, we realised

that many are either attached to specific projects with a unique functionality (like game tokens) or they are used to speculate. We needed a token that fits perfectly into the Bitsliced marketplace and the ecosystem. Since we are basically indexing SLICED to the real estate markets, we also needed to have a token with growth potential, but without the spikes and crashes. After discussing our plans with potential automotive partners, they mentioned one pre-requisite for a token that would be accepted to trade or support transactions: volatility! This is the reason why most shy away from Bitcoin specifically and crypto in general.

The most notable research paper about Bitcoin and volatility was the paper from Paraskevi K (2018) that compared different GARCH models to analyse the volatility of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. The AR-CGARCH was found to be the best modelling tool for crypto.
# 6
 Taking into account that volatility is intertwined with most cryptocurrencies, we had to discard most tokens as our project token. There was another strong reason for the creation of a new cryptocurrency: **correlation!**

It is no secret that most cryptocurrencies have a high-positive correlation with each other. Running an analysis using the **Pearson correlation coefficient** on the 15 biggest cryptocurrencies shows that 80% have a strong correlation to Bitcoin and Ethereum
# 7
 or to each other. This essentially means that they are &quot;tied&quot; together. If Bitcoin moves up, most currencies will follow. We analysed some smaller, more exotic tokens, but they are intrinsically bound to their underlying project scopes (mostly in-game currencies). This meant that we had to create a token that is &quot;clean&quot; from speculative drivers, is not correlated to existing cryptocurrencies and could be _indexed_ to the real estate and automotive markets. The result was the creation of **SLICED.**

**3.2 The Key driver of SLICED**

**SLICED** was designed to function within the **Bitsliced** marketplace app. Community members are able to mint, swap, buy, sell items using **SLICED** as a utility token. Furthermore, special activities inside the app generate fees that are also paid with **SLICED**.

The most important key driver of **SLICED** value proposition is the **tokenization of
 commercial transactions**. Bitsliced has been closing framework contracts with

partners in diverse industries like real estate and automotive distribution networks.

 Each transaction pays **2%** into the **SLICED fund**. The transaction partners receive a deposit of **SLICED** tokens paid into their wallet. The tokens are locked up and remain
 In the wallet until the lockup period is over. The wallet owners can then keep holding
 the tokens as a kind of insurance against devaluations, loss of value or to raise the
 profitability of their business.

**Business Case: Real Estate**

A real estate broker becomes a member of the **Bitsliced network.** Usually brokers receive a commission fee (brokerage fee) that varies worldwide, depending on the type of real estate transaction (commercial or residential) and the market. In some countries this fee is anywhere between 2% and 15% of the selling price
# 8
. In average a 6% fee is the most common throughout the world
# 9
.

 This would be the maximum profit on this transaction! The margins have a natural ceiling. **Bitsliced** offers both - the property buyer and the broker - an interesting proposition. Out of this fee, 2% flow into **SLICED**. **Bitsliced** issues a crypto debit card - that is associated with their **SLICED** wallet - to both parties. In the meantime, the tokens appraise in value. This is due to the business model structure described in

**Section 10.1** of this White Paper. Part of this payment will flow into the liquidity pool to sustain the price of **SLICED (1%)** and the other half is used to reinvest (stake, farm) and obtain profitability for all parties involved. After the lockup period (usually 3 months), both parties receive a deposit in the form of a **cash back payment**. The value of this will of course fluctuate, depending on market conditions and other factors.

This business model creates a constant **positive flow** or demand for **SLICED** and creates a **bullish scenario** , without the well known volatility spikes seen in other cryptocurrencies.

Why would a broker &quot;give up&quot; part of his margin? Why not invest these 2% himself and buy Bitcoin, Gold or other financial instruments? The advantage to the broker is that he is able to get a structured investment vehicle with a reduced risk strategy. Other assets are being traded for speculative reasons or used for other reasons (like Gold for example that has too many use cases associated with it
# 10
)

This is one of the main reasons why we created **SLICED**. To have an instrument that could be associated with a certain asset class, that is used exclusively for the purpose of the tokenization of transactions. **SLICED** is essentially _indexed_ to the assets participating in our economic ecosystem.

An investor buying **SLICED** is buying a token with practical utility (App marketplace) and also with a positive inflow of investment coming from real estate, automotive or collectibles. Through **SLICED** it is possible to invest in the worldwide real estate market. Tokens are issued based on **real world transactions** and not some arbitrary or speculative reason. Holders of **SLICED** know that the value comes from the constant feeding by concluded transactions in diverse industries.

**How much return can a real estate broker, an automotive distributor or a client expect from this model?**

**3.3 Projection: Growth potential for SLICED**

Traditional asset pricing equations mostly use a linear factor model. To obtain the core price of an asset class we rely on classic financial asset pricing theory (see Munk 2013 as an example
# 11
. The limitations of these models - as applied to crypto assets - are due to the technical nature of this new asset class (Bullmann, 2019
# 12
)

Liquidity, volatility, market capitalization, sentiment and the amount of nodes in a network all play an important role in the determination of token prices over time (numerous research papers attempt to create new models that are more adaptive and take the complexities of crypto into account - See here: &quot;The fair value of a token: How do markets price cryptocurrencies?&quot;
# 13

In the case of **SLICED** we took different approaches to establish the **initial base price** and to create **projection models**. **SLICED** will be sustained by the constant flow of closed real estate and automotive transactions (see **section 3.2** of this White Paper). This makes our token unique in the sense that we have to take into account fluctuations of these markets and also use the rate of adoption in our formula. With other words: **how fast can we close partnerships, onboard new clients and in what timeframe?**

 According to this input, we will issue **SLICED** at a steady, but controlled rate (see **section 4.1** of this White Paper). **Bitsliced** only issues tokens in tranches and only allowing a flow of supply that stays below market demand. All of this in an equilibrium with our real needs to keep the ecosystem of the APP working (network fees, etc. see **section 5** of this White Paper)

**First considerations: analysis of 108 crypto projects with similar characteristics**

One first glimpse was to analyse the data points of 108 crypto projects that have started in the past 7 years. We had to use weighted averages to take extremes into consideration (&quot;crypto winter&quot;-periods and bullish runs in 2021).

 It takes on average **725.19 days** for a project to go from launch to maturity (peak price). **55%** of the analysed projects reach their peak after **276.72 days**.

 It takes on average **294.45 days** to double in value (from initial launch). The adjusted value (taking out the extreme peaks of 2021) is **214.12 days**. It is safe to assume that - if a project goes well and the market is behaving under stable conditions - that a cryptocurrency will **double in value** within the first **7 months** since inception.

**40%** of the analysed projects reach growth rates of **582%** (adjusted for extreme peaks). **3%** fail and **57%** have growth rates over **582%** in an approximate time frame of \&lt; 12 months.

The complete table is published by **Bitsliced** and is available at request
# 14

**Determining SLICED initial token price**

Since **SLICED** was from the Beginning designed to function as an _indexed_ value (especially to real estate) and **Bitsliced LLC** is supplying the complete initial liquidity pool (through pre-sales, angel investors, private equity) and the initial token issuance is limited to less than **1 million tokens** , the calculated **initial token price was fixed at a rate of 0.50 Euros per token**. This is only possible because of a capped amount of tokens in circulation. **Bitsliced LLC** will hold this price as the **minimum floor price**.

**Outlook about future price projection**

Our outlook is based on several considerations. We used our analysis of the 108 crypto projects to gain insights into strategies, marketing, technical viability and other factors to have a baseline for our projection.

Since the release of tokens is **centralised** and strictly tied to incoming volume from sales transactions, we are confident that the following price projections are within realistic expectations:

Graph 1.1 - Possible Price Projections for **SLICED**

![](RackMultipart20220312-4-rh1cln_html_23ee220007550397.png)

To be on the safe side, we also used the **Bass Diffusion formula**
 **# 15** to calculate the rate of adoption for our business model. We assume that - once we have our first real estate partnership - it will be cost-effective and fast to acquire the next batch of volume. In this regard, please refer to **section 8** of this White Paper about Partnerships.

 To calculate the rate of adoption, we used the following criteria: US real estate market (6.1 million real estate transactions per year, base 2021
# 16
), which serves as the SAM and a target value of 1 million users as our subsection of the SAM. The factor for _p was established with 0.003 and the factor for q with 0.5_ which are common factors used in baseline predictions. For further reference, please check the link in the footnote.
# 17

Graph 1.2 - Possible user adoption for the **Bitsliced APP**

![](RackMultipart20220312-4-rh1cln_html_8f5d14b816a587cb.png)

Considering the above data and the **innovative aspect (novelty factor)** it is expected to see high adoption rates, especially considering early adopters in the crypto crowd. We can then assume that the **Bitsliced App** would reach - in the worst case scenario - 500.000 users after 12 months of introduction.

 Even cutting that in half and using an average sales price for a home of 453.000 US$
# 18
, we would reach a total volume of **113 billion US-Dollars**. Taking a 2% fee as our base it would mean that over **1.1 billion US-Dollars** would flow into **SLICED** and support the price, which would put **SLICED** among the Top 100 crypto currencies in the world (market cap values of March 5th, 2022 - see Coinmarketcap
# 19
)

 According to our timed release of tokens, every batch of **10 million Euros** in incoming volumewill trigger a release of **8 million SLICED tokens** , which confirms our **baseline** assumption as expressed in graph 1.1. Each subsequent batch of transactions will trigger a diminishing amount of tokens and therefore sustain price stability.

**Summary**

Our presented considerations leave out other markets like automotive, collectibles, art and luxury items, which are all part of our project scope. Projections are a good starting point for any business venture. We cannot - of course - assume that we know all the factors and that these projections are absolutely certain. The mission of any good team is to assess market conditions, continuously check deviations from the original projections and to take countermeasures. This is our stated goal and is an important part of our executive strategy **.**

**3.4 Features of the token (technical)**

**Blockchain:** Polygon (Matic) - Layer 2

**Standard:** ERC-20

**Token or Coin?** TOKEN

**Name of token:** SLICED

**SYMBOL:** SLICED

**Total Supply:** 250,000,000 SLICED

**Max Supply:** 250,000,000 SLICED

**Start of Project:** October 2021

**Burnable?** YES

**Mintable?** NO

**Freezable?** YES

**Blacklist wallets?** YES

**3.4.1 - Freezable (Pause) (Security)**

**SLICED** smart contract includes the _freeze functionality_ and the _pause function_. These functions were included in the smart contract to add another layer of security. A frozen token is a token that is created but cannot be transferred to another address until certain unlocking conditions are met. There are certain mechanisms and methods to freeze and unlock the tokens. If the smart contract detects suspicious activity, then specific accounts can be frozen. The process of freezing â even locking all current tokens that are in circulation is a safeguard measure. All tokens can be frozen for a variety of reasons i.e. a ban on certain token transactions in general, a ban on certain wallets or a ban on wallets with a certain amount. This is a measure of last resort and is communicated to the individual token holder or the community.

**3.4.2 - Function to Blacklist Wallet Addresses (Security)**

The _blacklist function_ is related to our security protocol. Certain known

exploits are included into listening events and associate hackers

wallets with the _blacklist function_. This is to prevent hackers from

moving tokens into other wallets or into liquidity pools.

**3.4.3 - Burnable (Scarcity &amp; Value)**

_Burn function_ per Solidity protocol is implemented in our smart contract. The burn rate is part of a proprietary formula to balance issuance of tokens with influx of volume and the total market cap. The reason for this function is to keep a steady price of **SLICED**. If - for example - real estate is in a downturn and less transactional volume is detected, then less tokens are issued per transaction, which raises the price of the individual token. This is of course regulated in relation to supply and demand mechanisms. The burn rate is dynamic and not fixed.

**3.4.4 - Capped (Scarcity &amp; Value)**

The total cap is limited to 250 million tokens. This value was calculated

based on a series of factors. Since **SLICED** is associated with

transactions coming from real estate and automotive industries we had to have enough tokens to cover the heavy transaction volume in these sectors, without creating an oversupply and therefore running into inflationary issues.

**3.4.5 - Polygon - Layer 2 network characteristics**

The Polygon platform operates using the Ethereum blockchain, and

connects Ethereum-based projects. Using the Polygon platform can

increase the **flexibility, scalability, and sovereignty** of a blockchain

project while still affording the **security, interoperability, and structural benefits** of the Ethereum blockchain.

Another aspect was the need for high speed transactions with a low gas fee structure.Polygon uses a modified proof-of-stake mechanism that enables transactions to be processed quickly and cheaply.

Currently the top transaction speed of the Polygon network reaches a maximum of **65 thousand transactions per second**. Theoretically this number will be scalable to millions of transactions per second, once the Ethereum network will fork into what is known as Ethereum 2.0.

Polygon has reached a remarkable milestone with over 7.000 dApps and therefore even surpassing the underlying daily transaction volume of Ethereum
# 20

The depth and breadth of Polygon is growing at a fast pace. Some of

the most renowned crypto projects run or use Polygon to scale or develop. Among them are _Decentraland, Valuables, Aave, Sandbox, Opensea, Uniswap._
_# 21_Another important milestone was the integration of Polygon into the Wirex - a leading payment platform with over 4.5 million users and access to 81 million retailers in over 130 countries!
# 22

**The Bitsliced Development Team decided to build SLICED on Polygon after considering the potential for future growth and the power to scale our token with low fees for the community.**

**3.5 - Utility of the token**

**3.5.1 - Staking option and Liquidity pool program (LP tokens)**

In order to give early token buyers an incentive to invest into **SLICED** and the **Bitsliced** project as a whole, we decided to create our own **staking platform (dApp)**.

Present token buyers and holders can decide to stake their tokens and get a **dynamic APY (annual percentage yield)**.

 The obtained yield will vary based on how many investors are staking. The more investors are staking the less the rewards. Rewards will be paid in **SLICED or in DAI (stablecoin)**. The system rewards long term staking. The longer an investor stakes, the higher the yield curve.

 A second form of income or yield generation is to obtain so-called **LP-Tokens (Liquidity provider tokens)**. This is a **high yield program** because every investment flows into the liquidity pool, which in the end is keeping the price of **SLICED** stable and raising in value.

**Yields and potential results will be announced once both programs go online (please refer to section 7.1 of the White Paper.**

**Both programs will cease to exist once we go online with the APP! These are temporary strategies in the startup phase of Bitsliced.**

**3.5.2 - Equaliser function**

**SLICED** serves as an **equaliser** between markets. If the automotive market is down in one country or locality, it draws (sells) more **SLICED** to make up for low sales figures. As explained in **section 3.2** of this White Paper it serves essentially as a &quot;rainy day fund&quot; for all its participants. If one market is down another is up (whether that is in another neighbour city or another country). Market participants that have a downturn benefit from market participants that are doing well. The latter will be buying **SLICED** and adding to their stash, whilst the ones in economic difficulties are able to sell. This will happen **naturally and NOT as Over-the-counter (OTC)** transactions, since at this point **Bitsliced LLC** will not intervene in the market activities of it&#39;s participants but rather serve as a regulator and issuer of additional tokens, until all tokens are in circulation. Once we reach this milestone it will be **demand and supply** rules, users and the community determining the value

of **SLICED.**

**3.5.3 - Ecosystem fees**

**SLICED** is the native exchange token in the **Bitsliced APP.** The marketplace and all functionality will be paid and serviced through our token. For more details please refer to **section 5** of this White Paper. The fee structure will be announced at a later date, once the APP is in Beta stage and an update to this White Paper will follow. Please refer to **section 7** of this document for details (Roadmap and Milestones).

**4. Tokenomics: How we will distribute the 250.000.000 SLICED tokens!**

**4.1 Emission of tokens**

**SLICED** will be released in a **delayed fashion**. As can be seen in **section 4.2** of this document, the unlocking happens in stages and is hard coded into the smart contract. Stages are determined by key factors like: reaching of milestones (if we fail to reach a milestone, no more tokens reach the market, avoiding an oversupply and price crashes or instability).

**Section 3.3** explained that issuing new tokens is further limited to real transactions happening on the network. If the adoption process is delayed for some unknown reason or the market is in a slump, then no tokens are released. These two aspects that are part of the business model and the smart contract should ensure price stability and a healthy, steady growth.

**4.2 Token Distribution**

**40% Open Market:**

100.000.000 SLICED

(Liquidity pool will be locked for 2 years)

**20% Rewards:**

50,000,000 SLICED

(10% unlocked by month during 10 months)

- Staking : 20,000,000 SLICED with a dynamic, variable APY
- Liquidity pool Program : 27,000.000 SLICED with a dynamic,

variable APY

- Bug bounties, Affiliates, Publishers: 3,000,000 SLICED

**15% Marketing &amp; Listing**

37,500,000 SLICED

(5% unlocked by month during 20 months)

**10% Development**

25,000,000 SLICED

(5% unlocked by month during 20 months)

These tokens will be allocated to the development of the application, smart contracts, and maintenance of the app.

**5% Team**

12,500,000 SLICED

(10% unlocked by month during 10 months)

**5% Legal &amp; Regulatory**

12,500,000 SLICED

(5% unlocked by month during 20 months)

**5% Launchpad**

12,500,000 SLICED

30% will be claimable the first day, the other 70% will have a soft lockup for a

period of 3 months (so they will be receiving 1% per day)

**5. The Bitsliced APP marketplace: Trade Anything. Anywhere.**

The flagship product of **Bitsliced** is the NFT marketplace that goes beyond trading or

buying crypto assets. We have envisioned a true quantum leap into what the

blockchain can do for us in terms of value and quality of living!

 The APP will be a combination of a marketplace, merged with a community of

like-minded individuals that love to collect, exchange, share and trade items.

**5.1 Features**

**5.1.1 Gamification of trades**

The app will have strong aspects of _gamification_. This goes from the UI interface, the graphics and the interactions itself. Minting items and collecting them will be almost like collecting _PokemonI_ cards! Keeping overviews of trading procedures should be easy and fun. Since real estate transactions will eventually take place within the app, the system still needs to be robust and secure.

**5.1.2 Channels**

Channels is a new concept that the development team introduced. They are more than just &quot;groups&quot; or communities. Channel creators have to **mint** them and in the background they keep unique features, much like any NFT object. This gives us a plethora of possibilities! These channels are able to generate revenue for the members or channel creators. They will essentially function as &quot;mini hedge funds&quot; with autonomous revenue streams. Fee sharing is possible. Users own their own data and are free to monetise it.

**5.1.3 Community**

Being part of an active, enthusiastic community with common goals, shared interests is a big part of the **Bitsliced** APP! Collectors of certain comic books or pieces of art can group together, share rich information. Exchange value that goes beyond selling or buying objects. NFT&#39;s will have rich features and bring the exchange of items to another level. Community members are the citizens of the **Bitsliced** platform.

**5.1.4 In-App payment system &amp; crypto debit card**

The APP includes an advanced internal payment system based on **SLICED**. The wallet offers of course the possibility to collect other crypto currencies, exchange them for fiat or **SLICED**. Expenses such as buying a coffee or paying the rent are reflected inside the transaction section. Staking rewards, fees and affiliate earnings are debited to the **Bitsliced debit card**. All in one seamless flow of information.

**5.1.5 Swapping**

Another unique feature of the marketplace is the option to _swap_ items. Instead of selling a collectible to then buy another item, it is possible to create collections, favourites and offer owners of other items a direct swap. This is possible due to the proprietary **NFT-based** technology that **Bitsliced** is developing.

**5.2 Bitsliced NFT&#39;s - Going beyond trading or exchanging value**

The **Bitsliced NFT System** is a true universal digital **certificate** that guarantees that

underlying due diligence was concluded. Any homeowner or real estate broker that

mints a property to convert it into an **NFT** is in reality creating a unique digital

certificate that identifies the object and creates a **seal of trust**.

**Bitsliced** and it&#39;s partners conclude all the due diligence steps, verifies all the documents and legal procedures, **before** the object is minted as an **NFT**. International real estate investors often have to check local regulations, verify if a property is up to date with tax payments, if there are mortgages or other debts, if the construction complies with all local regulations. Adding to this are difficulties with language barriers and local currency fluctuations.

In the future, an investor will check if there is a **digital certificate in the form of a Bitsliced NFT** on our platform and will know that all these documents and processes have been verified and successfully vetted. The **NFT certificate is a guarantee** that buying the underlying asset is almost risk-free. In the future the transaction can be concluded within the platform using **SLICED** as the payment method. In this case the investor is even shielded from currency fluctuations. A true revolution in international trade.

 True cross-border transactions and trading of any object is only possible if there is **trust**. A **Bitsliced NFT** provides this level of transparency and trust!

**7.2 The Future: Virtual Spaces!**

The **Bitsliced APP** , the **NFT processes** and the **business model** are all precursors to the next big revolution in the digital space: virtual spaces or a metaverse. The developments are definitely shaping up and **Bitsliced** will be already positioned to participate and become a key partner to other crypto ventures. We see our **NFT** system as the ideal entry point to move physical objects into the metaverse. They will be easily identifiable and trustworthy.

**8. Partnerships**

The success of **SLICED** hinges on the growing network of strategic partnerships with key stakeholders in the real estate, automotive and luxury items industries. We already started to negotiate framework contracts with **automotive distributor networks in Brazil, the Netherlands and Portugal.** Furthermore we entered negotiations with real estate brokerage firms in **Europe, USA** and **South America.** At the date of this writing we also started to approach luxury brands in Europe (shoes, pens, collectibles). Stay connected with us through our _Discord_ channel or our website to receive notifications about announcements in this regard.

**Due to understandable reasons of confidentiality and strategic needs, we are not revealing the names of these partners. This is to protect our intellectual property from competitors. This is also in the best interest of our token holders and investors. Once the project is reaching more maturity we will reveal and publish the contractual partnerships to the general public.**

Another important aspect are partnerships to execute and deliver on the premises of this White Paper. Our core team is not enough to create all the necessary assets and make **Bitsliced** a success story. Our smart contract developers are top professionals who have worked with world renowned crypto projects. Due to contractual obligations we are legally bound to confidentiality and not allowed to reveal details about previous clients. The app will be developed by one of Europe&#39;s best software development firms.

**9. Legals &amp; Regulations**

One important consideration is the legal aspect of ownership. Blockchain

technologies and business ventures based on cryptographic assets are relatively recent advancements in innovation. Law makers and regulators are often behind and current legislation lags behind the speed of innovation. This represents a problem to many crypto-based ventures!

One example is fractional ownership in real estate. If several parties buy ownership of a property through the acquisition of an NFT, then several questions arise: **who is the &quot;real&quot; owner of the property? If the notarised and registered owner(s) decide to sell the property, do the investors with a stake acquired through partial investments have a say or a vote in the decision making process? How are proceeds (from rents, etc.) or costs accrued and distributed?**

**Bitsliced** understands that it will take many steps and in some cases many years until the world is fully ready for tokenization and fractional ownership of assets. We will approach this challenge in phases.

We decided therefore to cooperate with local authorities, government agencies, legal entities instead of &quot;fighting&quot; the status quo. There is a delicate balance between advancing with innovation and giving existing systems the time to transition into a new era.

Our approach is to create a platform, with a business model that sits on top of the current legacy systems and make this transition easier. As an example: in the first phase buyers of our NFT&#39;s are NOT buying the underlying asset directly! They still have to follow current legislation in the different geographic locations. **Bitsliced** makes this process many times easier by our NFT process.

 Due to this approach none of our systems, strategies or business models are in conflict with regulators, lawmakers and governmental institutions.

**10. Revenue Streams (Business Model)**

**Bitsliced &amp; SLICED** represent an attractive investment opportunity for VC firms, hedge funds and individual investors. Although **Bitsliced** is charging a 2% fee over transactions realised with **SLICED** , there is additional earning potential that comes from different streams of revenue, such as:

  - Platform fees generated from in-app/webapp transactions, transaction fees from trading and minting NFT&#39;s, the minting of channels and the creation of community groups.

  - In-App advertisement placements, partnerships with brands (data about home and automotive owners allows for targeted advertising). The advertising model is not intrusive or abusive like many common systems in social media, since our users are remunerated for voluntarily sharing their data. Users are the owners of their own data and choose how much they are willing to reveal and get compensated in **SLICED** (a similar system is already set in place with the **Brave browser**
 **# 23** )

  - Transaction fees from our crypto debit card

  - Reinvesting of token profits into DeFi instruments: staking, farming, lending through the app to buy assets in the form of NFT&#39;s

**Final Thoughts**

**Bitsliced** is in the business of tokenizing _everything_. This process will take many stages. We have **2 Phases** before us.

**Phase 1:** putting **SLICED** into circulation through pre-sales, Decentralised Exchanges and the staking program. Most importantly also through the tokenization of **transactions** (companies can add more margin or profit by paying 2% from every transaction into **SLICED** ) and **Bitsliced** pays out a cash back to them and their customers. This has two advantages: **SLICED** is gaining a customer base, which will benefit the APP/marketplace once it is ready and second the value of **SLICED** is continuously supported, giving us the financial backup to go into **Phase 2**.

**Phase 2** : with the liquidity and the capital from **Phase 1** we are able to fully develop, launch and promote the **NFT system with the APP marketplace**. This will be fully financed by the events from the previous phase. Once the APP goes online, we will continue to tokenize transactions, but this will happen as an in-app transaction.
